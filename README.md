# MERNapp

This is a back-end application project developed with JavaScript using Express and Node.js technologies, along with the MySQL database.

The purpose of this application is to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data in a Relational database.

This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for a more organized and modular code base.

This project is my own and serves to complement my studies in backend programming using NodeJs and adjacent libraries.
