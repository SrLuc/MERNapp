# MERNapp

This is a **Fullstack application**  project developed with *JavaScript* using *Express* and *Node.js* technologies, to develop a **RestFull API** with connection to a *MySQL* database.

To render the API data, I'm using ReactJS with *Typescript* template, and also using the *Styled-Componen*t CSS library to style the project.

The purpose of this application is to **provide CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data in a Relational database.

**This project follows the MVC** (Model-View-Controller) designed pattern for a more organized and modular code base.

*This project is still in development*... and your idea is my own.

In addition, this project serves to complement my studies in backend/fullstack programming using market tools with the use of libraries.


## Technical Features

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- MySQL Database Integration
- *API* with **MVC** pattern
- *Typescript* with *Styled Components*

## Stack 

**Front-end:** React, Axios, Styled-Component, Material UI

**Back-end:** Node, Express, MySQL, CORS, dotEnv, bodyParse


## How use
### Step 1
- Download the project using *git clone*
- Open the vscode and the terminal
- in **frontend** folder run *npm install*
- in **backend** folder run *npm install*

### Step 2
in the **backend** folder, create a **.env** file and inside it paste this code
 - DB_HOST = 'localhost'
 - DB_PORT = 3306
 - DB_USER = *'you database user'*
 - DB_PASS = *you database password*
 - DB_NAME = 'psydjs'
 - API_ENDPOINT = 4040

### Step 3
- in **frontend** folder run *npm run dev* to inicialize the view
- in **backend** folder run *npm run start* to inicialize the server
