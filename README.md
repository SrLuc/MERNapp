# MERNapp

This is a **Fullstack application**  project developed with *JavaScript* using *Express* and *Node.js* technologies, to develop a **RestFull API** with connection to a *MySQL* database.

To render the API data, I'm using ReactJS with *Typescript* template, and also using the *Styled-Componen*t CSS library to style the project.

The purpose of this application is to **provide CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data in a Relational database.

**This project follows the MVC** (Model-View-Controller) designed pattern for a more organized and modular code base.

*This project is still in development*... and your idea is my own.

In addition, this project serves to complement my studies in backend/fullstack programming using market tools with the use of libraries.
